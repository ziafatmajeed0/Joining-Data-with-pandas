1
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:19,887
-I'm here to take you home.
-Move!

2
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,122
I can't do that.

3
00:00:25,193 --> 00:00:26,194
What's going on?

4
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:27,895
I've been getting the headaches
since Andy left.

5
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:31,065
When I touch things,
they begin crumbling.

6
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:32,533
You're with the Purifiers?
I don't think

7
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:34,335
-I'm down to join a...
-Hate group?

8
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:35,736
The mutants that escaped

9
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:37,671
from the mental hospital
are dangerous. Show everybody

10
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:40,074
that the Purifiers
are part of the solution.

11
00:00:40,108 --> 00:00:42,910
Come on,
the doc's ready for you.

12
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,675
Time for another exercise,
girls.

13
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:25,453
This is a bad man

14
00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:27,488
with a secret.
I need you

15
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:30,591
to look inside his mind
and tell me what it is.

16
00:01:34,128 --> 00:01:35,763
Don't make me ask twice, girls.

17
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:43,937
Please don't.

18
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:46,440
He's scared.

19
00:01:46,474 --> 00:01:48,809
-He thinks you'll find
his family.
-And hurt them,

20
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:51,579
-because they're mutants.
-DDig deeper.

21
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,314
Tell me where they are.

22
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:55,082
He doesn't want
to think about it.

23
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,285
He doesn't want us to know.

24
00:01:57,318 --> 00:02:00,788
Then work together,
just like we talked about.

25
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,292
Three minds in one.

26
00:02:10,698 --> 00:02:12,833
Please don't make us.

27
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:15,035
He's so scared for his family.

28
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:17,037
You know the rules, Esme.

29
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,341
Do you care about his family...

30
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:21,809
or yours?

31
00:02:35,323 --> 00:02:36,690
Please! Please don't!

32
00:02:36,724 --> 00:02:38,392
They'll kill them!

33
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:27,375
Hey. Sorry, they, uh...

34
00:03:27,408 --> 00:03:29,777
they need us in training,
like, now.

35
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,945
What, again?
We're training again?

36
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:34,415
Yeah. It's just
what the Frosts said.

37
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:37,585
They've had us running
through crazy simulations

38
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:39,219
nonstop all week.

39
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:40,888
What is it this time?

40
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:44,057
Attacking a armored
personnel carrier?

41
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:45,926
A citywide chase?

42
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,861
I heard something
about a SWAT team, actually.

43
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:49,430
Unreal.

44
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:52,766
This just keeps getting
better and better.

45
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,968
I think Reeva just wants to
prepare us for the next mission.

46
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:56,904
And where's she been lately?

47
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:58,872
She even in the building?

48
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:01,208
You know how she is.
Out doing important stuff.

49
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,943
Never talks about it.

50
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:06,647
Yeah, well, she better start.

51
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:10,250
So, does-does that mean
you're coming, or...?

52
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:12,185
'Cause Rebecca's
already down there.

53
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:16,324
Yes, I'll be there in a minute.

54
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:18,191
Okay.

55
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:22,296
Oh.

56
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,732
I'm sorry, baby girl.

57
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,634
Mama's got to work.

58
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:28,836
Yeah.

59
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:32,673
Hmm?

60
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:34,642
What about this one?

61
00:04:37,545 --> 00:04:39,146
Everything has
to have sleeves now.

62
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,486
Ugh. I can't believe we have
to wear last season's look

63
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:48,789
because you let
that human flashlight grab you.

64
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:55,896
Hologram simulation active.

65
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:02,803
Open fire!

66
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:10,378
Get 'em!

67
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,861
Brava.

68
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:30,664
-Still needs work.
-I can do better.

69
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:32,666
I was slow with those guys
at the end there.

70
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,735
No, you were awesome.

71
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:35,836
Look who breezed in.

72
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:37,705
Is there something wrong, Lorna?

73
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:40,374
You tell me. We're training
for some mystery job

74
00:05:40,408 --> 00:05:41,975
by playing
SWAT team Whac-A-Mole

75
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,677
with a bunch of holograms?

76
00:05:43,711 --> 00:05:45,813
No need to be upset.

77
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,048
These are just
worst-case scenarios.

78
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:50,017
Last time we went out in the
field, we nearly got ambushed

79
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,552
by the Mutant Underground,
and now we're, what,

80
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:54,054
preparing to take fire
from all sides?

81
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:56,056
What the hell kind of mission
is this?

82
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:57,925
An important one.

83
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:01,595
Well, here's something
that's important to me.

84
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:02,996
My baby,

85
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,264
who I've barely seen in two days

86
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,033
because of all of this training,

87
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:09,503
who may notice if Mommy comes
home riddled with bullets.

88
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:11,238
I need to know the actual plan.

89
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:14,074
You'll know when you need
to know. Trust me.

90
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:15,576
We're all on the same side here,
Lorna.

91
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:16,944
Are we?

92
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:19,780
I'll make this real simple
for you.

93
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:22,616
Either tell me what this little
operation is or I'm out.

94
00:06:36,464 --> 00:06:40,233
I don't see any more
signs of a concussion.

95
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:45,105
I am gonna go out on a limb
and pronounce you

96
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:47,107
-recovered.
-Thanks.

97
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,709
How's Dr. Kelsey?

98
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,377
It was a close call.

99
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,981
He'll be better by the time
the clinic reopens.

100
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:56,383
He's a bit rattled.

101
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,651
I can imagine.

102
00:06:57,685 --> 00:07:00,253
On the bright side,

103
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:03,256
I was able to track down
the psychiatrist

104
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,892
that worked
at that mental institution

105
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,426
where you saw Andy.

106
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,229
I made us an appointment
for tomorrow.

107
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,665
-You really think
that's a good idea?
-Yeah.

108
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:13,901
She worked at that hospital
that locked up mutants.

109
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,435
Yeah, well, apparently,

110
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:17,137
she felt bad about
the way they were treated,

111
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,406
so she might be willing to give
us some information

112
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,108
on that girl
that Andy broke out.

113
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:22,275
And if she won't?

114
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:24,244
Hey, we have to try.

115
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:27,247
If we can find out why they
wanted that girl, Rebecca,

116
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,449
we are one step closer to Andy.

117
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:40,193
You sure you're gonna be okay
without me tomorrow?

118
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:41,929
I still think I should go.

119
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,531
Reed, you need to train.

120
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:46,199
We have to get your powers
under control.

121
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:48,135
The-the anxiety meds
aren't working

122
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:50,504
and the side effects
are getting worse.

123
00:07:50,538 --> 00:07:52,439
-Can't we just change the dose?
-Honey.

124
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,808
I know you want this
to just go away,

125
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:58,579
but you have to deal with it,
not just drug it.

126
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:02,850
It's so difficult to explain.

127
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:06,219
When it happens, I-I feel
like I'm drowning.

128
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:08,188
Just like...

129
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:10,991
Like what?

130
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:15,062
It's like when I got sick
when I was a kid.

131
00:08:16,764 --> 00:08:19,499
-When my dad made me sick.
-Hey.

132
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,672
It's like everything's happening
at once.

133
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:29,643
Just let John help you.

134
00:08:29,677 --> 00:08:31,144
I don't see how training
can help.

135
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:32,512
It's just something
that happens.

136
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:34,081
Just try.

137
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:38,351
I remember you at law school.

138
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:41,589
You were good at learning
new things.

139
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:49,697
You're pretty damn good
at anything when you want to be.

140
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,936
You've always made me feel
like I can do anything.

141
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:58,105
You can.

142
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:15,188
You all remember Turner, here.

143
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:18,592
It was thanks to him we hit
that mutie clinic last week.

144
00:09:18,626 --> 00:09:20,260
And he's been doing
a real good job

145
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,529
on some of the patient files
we found there.

146
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,231
Jace.

147
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:29,069
According to the files,
they were sending a lot

148
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:31,104
of their patients to a hospital
up in Baltimore,

149
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:33,774
but it turns out, some of 'em
never showed up.

150
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:36,043
The ones with arrest warrants.

151
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,444
You thinking Mutant Underground?

152
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:39,279
Who else can make mutant
fugitives disappear?

153
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,448
There's a station up there,
I guarantee it.

154
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:42,650
-Now...
-Yeah, so let's haul ass

155
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:44,718
up to Baltimore
and start shaking them trees.

156
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:46,887
-Boom.

157
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,255
Just listen up for a second.

158
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:51,158
Please. We need
to be smart about this.

159
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:53,827
These terrorists have stayed
ahead of the Sentinel Services

160
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:55,295
because they work the system.

161
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,997
They use our own society
against us.

162
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,666
Court orders, warrants.

163
00:09:58,699 --> 00:09:59,900
One of them scurries
into a church,

164
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,168
suddenly they're untouchable.

165
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,503
Now, we don't have those rules.

166
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:06,473
We can flush 'em out,
run 'em to ground, tie 'em up

167
00:10:06,506 --> 00:10:08,108
in a neat little bow
for the feds to collect.

168
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:10,110
So we just start doing
their jobs for 'em?

169
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:14,481
Let me ask you something,

170
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:16,516
guy who brings a .50-cal
to a meeting.

171
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:17,484
Why are you here?

172
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:20,620
Why are you all here?

173
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:22,189
'Cause I think it's for the same
reason that I'm here.

174
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:23,691
You want to make your
neighborhood safe again, right?

175
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:26,159
And I'd say that most people
agree with you.

176
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:28,028
But guess what.

177
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:30,430
Mr. and Mrs. PTA
don't want to be

178
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,365
on the same side
as a hate group.

179
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,034
And if you keep running around,

180
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:36,036
waving your guns,
beating up doctors,

181
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:37,971
that is exactly
how people see you.

182
00:10:38,005 --> 00:10:41,608
They see you as a hate group,
but if you do this right,

183
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,176
they'll come running
to your cause.

184
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,045
Did I miss the part
where we put you in charge?

185
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:47,848
Hey! Settle down.

186
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:49,216
Here's how it's gonna be:

187
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:50,650
I've talked to leadership.

188
00:10:50,684 --> 00:10:52,152
They want results.

189
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:54,121
We're gonna give this plan
a shot.

190
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,623
On my orders.

191
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,725
We clear?

192
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:00,293
Truth is,

193
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:02,029
it's time somebody solved
the mutant problem.

194
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:05,465
And it's going to be us.

195
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:17,577
I was hoping you'd come.

196
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:21,715
Andy, what is this place?

197
00:11:21,749 --> 00:11:23,483
This is where we train.

198
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,085
You could have killed me.

199
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:27,387
I know. I'm sorry,

200
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,856
but I did warn you.

201
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:30,023
Just don't get in my way again,
okay?

202
00:11:30,057 --> 00:11:31,258
This isn't you.

203
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,693
How could you hurt
your own family?

204
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:34,995
This is my family now.

205
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,830
And they're making me stronger.

206
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:38,298
-They could make you
stronger, too.
-Don't.

207
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,603
This doesn't have to be a war.

208
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:45,939
Aren't you sick of running?

209
00:11:45,973 --> 00:11:47,841
The Inner Circle
is helping people.

210
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,242
So are we.

211
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:51,344
Do you really think that getting
a few mutants

212
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,046
to Mexico is helping?

213
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,750
Lauren, we can do things
that you can't imagine.

214
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:34,321
I thought you said
you could handle

215
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:35,655
training the team
while I was away.

216
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:37,290
We're sorry.

217
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:39,426
You knew how volatile Polaris
was when you recruited her.

218
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:43,831
I believe you said
we "needed her spirit."

219
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:46,599
Don't worry, we can bring her
back into the fold.

220
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:49,269
She's used to being a leader
in the Underground.

221
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:51,071
She doesn't like being left
in the dark.

222
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,172
None of us do.

223
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:53,606
I manage information

224
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,308
to protect all of us.

225
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:56,609
Of course.

226
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:58,078
But giving Lorna
a piece of the puzzle

227
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,346
isn't gonna threaten
the whole picture.

228
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:01,248
We asked her to join us.

229
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,782
And believe in our cause.

230
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:04,918
It seems we have a choice.

231
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:07,821
Trust her or lose her.

232
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:16,196
Fine. I have business I need
to take care of, so handle this.

233
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:17,965
Of course.

234
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:20,133
You can count on us.

235
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:22,169
And, girls...

236
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:24,905
Don't make me regret it.

237
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:39,719
I'm on my way.

238
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:42,122
Is everything arranged
on your end?

239
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,892
Good, because if anything
goes wrong,

240
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:47,527
suffice it to say
that the fallout from me

241
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,597
will be nothing compared
to the consequences for you.

242
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,001
-It's okay.

243
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:55,502
It's okay.

244
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:58,638
Mama's sorry
she hasn't been around much.

245
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:08,548
Shh.

246
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:24,331
Yeah, shh.

247
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,733
I finally got her to sleep.

248
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:29,369
She was screaming all morning.

249
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:31,004
We talked to Reeva.

250
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:32,839
I told you,

251
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,108
I'm not running blindfolded
into a slaughter.

252
00:14:35,142 --> 00:14:37,444
And we're not asking you to.

253
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:39,112
We want to tell you the plan.

254
00:14:39,146 --> 00:14:40,547
Really?

255
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,249
We have maps, route plans,

256
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:44,184
-blueprints of the target.
-When things go sideways,

257
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:47,554
blueprints are almost as useful
as to-do lists.

258
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:50,590
Look, I need to go there,
in person, to see it for myself.

259
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,060
I need to know what I'm risking
my life for.

260
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:54,962
Okay? I owe it to her.

261
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,399
Hmm.

262
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,571
All right, then.

263
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:06,573
We'll go.

264
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:12,980
Up till now, your powers
have manifested accidentally,

265
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:14,414
under stress.

266
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:16,416
When your emotions
are out of control,

267
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:17,650
your powers are out of control.

268
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:19,452
I'm not out of control.
I'm fine.

269
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:21,254
All right. Show me. Here.

270
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:25,925
Just... relax.

271
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:28,728
-Close your eyes and breathe.

272
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,563
How do you feel?

273
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:33,166
I feel like a guy
with his hand on a radiator.

274
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,867
Try and dig a bit deeper.

275
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:40,974
Can't you just show me
the technique?

276
00:15:41,008 --> 00:15:43,143
Th-There's no one technique.

277
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:44,844
All right,
activating your powers,

278
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:48,448
it starts with what's going on
with you internally.

279
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:50,850
Okay,

280
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,852
try this.

281
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:55,822
Focus on a time
your powers manifested.

282
00:15:55,855 --> 00:16:00,293
How you felt when you crashed
the car with Lauren.

283
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:02,529
-Dad!

284
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:12,205
Nothing's happening.

285
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:14,774
Reed, I can hear your heartbeat.
It's not even elevated.

286
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,277
I get it, Reed.
You want a shortcut, don't you?

287
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,646
You want to make up
30 years of experience

288
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,314
in one afternoon
without doing any work.

289
00:16:21,348 --> 00:16:23,716
But to get a handle on this,
you have to face your fears.

290
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,685
I know you're scared
to think about memories

291
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:27,687
-that are too painful.
-That is not true.

292
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,622
Okay, you have another excuse
for me? You have another reason

293
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,191
-why you think you're special?

294
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:36,996
So you gonna tell me
you're in control right now?

295
00:16:38,065 --> 00:16:39,832
Guys,

296
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:41,034
you got to see this.

297
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:42,502
Shatter called.
He just sent this.

298
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:44,904
Purifiers bombed
a sanctuary church in Baltimore.

299
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:46,239
-My God.
-They're bombing churches now.

300
00:16:46,273 --> 00:16:48,575
I mean, that's a crazy big step,
even for them.

301
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:50,243
Yeah, they got a big group of
refugees who've lost everything

302
00:16:50,277 --> 00:16:51,378
and no way to move 'em.

303
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:53,046
Shatter's gonna take in
as many as he can

304
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,482
at the Baltimore station,
but he needs our help.

305
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,484
They need IDs, cars, the works.

306
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:58,551
Yeah, well,
I checked police scanners.

307
00:16:58,585 --> 00:16:59,819
The cops are out in full force.

308
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,054
It's not a good time to move.

309
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:02,189
Yeah.

310
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:03,590
That's why we have to go.

311
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:05,492
We have to show them
we're still here.

312
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:07,194
We have to stand together

313
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:09,262
with the Mutant Underground,
especially now.

314
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,011
It's too bad this is

315
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,614
what it takes to get
your ugly mugs up here.

316
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:29,616
Shatter, good to see you, too.

317
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:32,018
-Good to see you.
-So, what's the situation?

318
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,521
We got about 20 refugees
from the bombed church.

319
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,289
They've been filtering in
all day. And we already got

320
00:17:36,323 --> 00:17:38,024
a full house to begin with.

321
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,127
Things have gotten worse
ever since that hospital attack

322
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,894
-last week.
-Uh, great.

323
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:43,896
The Inner Circle makes the
mess-- we get to clean it up.

324
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,298
Oh, it's worse than that.

325
00:17:45,332 --> 00:17:47,400
The human groups
that used to help us,

326
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:48,601
they won't even take our calls.

327
00:17:51,338 --> 00:17:53,740
We need to get the names
of the people who came in

328
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:55,608
and start making some new IDs.
I'll get my equipment.

329
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:56,576
We'll get on the names.

330
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:03,916
-You sure
you're okay to do this?
-Why?

331
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,718
-You think I'm gonna explode?
-Reed, you disintegrated

332
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,720
a cast-iron radiator earlier.

333
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,789
I was just... overwhelmed.

334
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,224
Look, I'm strong enough
to keep it together

335
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:12,725
while I make some IDs.

336
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,427
Reed, it's not
about being strong.

337
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:15,895
You're not gonna know
what's gonna set you off

338
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,230
until you deal
with the fear and the anger

339
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:18,931
-that's triggering this.
-You don't know anything

340
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:21,234
-about what I'm feeling.
-No, but you do.

341
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:23,236
And you need to own
those feelings

342
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,738
or you'll never have control
of this.

343
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,140
When your father suppressed
your X-Gene,

344
00:18:27,174 --> 00:18:28,575
he also robbed you of the chance

345
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,109
to work through this
when you should have.

346
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:31,811
John, I appreciate it,
but I'll work through it

347
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,446
in my way.

348
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,860
We got all the personal
information we could.

349
00:18:47,894 --> 00:18:50,597
Lots of these folks
have been living

350
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,999
in shelters and churches
for a while now.

351
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:55,134
Should be enough.
Let me see.

352
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:58,104
I heard a little of what
you was talking about with John.

353
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,174
-Yeah, well, that's not...
-Uh, no, just hear me out.

354
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,843
You know how I found out
I was a mutant?

355
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:05,478
I went to sleep one day

356
00:19:05,512 --> 00:19:07,380
a normal kid,

357
00:19:07,414 --> 00:19:09,616
and I woke up looking like this,

358
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,818
and everything I touched
was turning to crystal.

359
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:13,820
It was terrifying.

360
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:15,655
When I looked in that mirror,

361
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:17,524
I saw a monster.

362
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:19,726
So...

363
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:22,229
I tried to kill it.

364
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:25,131
I didn't put out the lights,
but...

365
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,800
I cracked the windows a bit.

366
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:30,002
I guess, sometimes,
the more you...

367
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:32,739
reject the things
you can't face,

368
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,207
the worse you make it.

369
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,685
Here you go.

370
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,191
Ugh, chamomile. Really?

371
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:55,094
Well, if you're gonna be a yoga
mom, you got to look the part.

372
00:19:56,263 --> 00:19:58,231
You wanted to see the target.

373
00:19:58,265 --> 00:19:59,799
There it is.

374
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,239
A bank?

375
00:20:06,273 --> 00:20:07,740
It's not just a bank.

376
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:09,342
They've got
a mutant detection system.

377
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:11,778
We can't get close
without setting off alarms.

378
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:13,780
Now I get why Reeva
was having us train

379
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:15,882
-to take fire from all sides.
-Lorna,

380
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:18,184
this place was built
on mutant suffering.

381
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:21,621
Creed Financial started funding
mutant slavery in the '50s

382
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:23,290
in South America.

383
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:26,058
They pushed through anti-mutant
legislation in the '70s,

384
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:27,860
for slumlords in mutant ghettos.

385
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:30,763
And they spent the '90s
creating the Kick epidemic.

386
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:33,533
They've got their hands
in everything,

387
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,868
even local Purifier chapters.

388
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:38,104
But this, this is
exactly the kind of thing

389
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:39,706
you joined the Inner Circle for.

390
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,374
With all of Reeva's secrets,

391
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:43,743
how am I supposed to know
what anything's for?

392
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:45,645
You saw what happened
after we hit the hospital.

393
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:48,715
Hundreds of mutants
took to the streets.

394
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:51,484
We hit this place,
maybe thousands.

395
00:20:51,518 --> 00:20:54,854
We'll inspire an army.

396
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:00,126
All right, look...

397
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,894
this one...

398
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:03,496
it's not just a cause.

399
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:06,433
It's personal.

400
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:08,000
For me

401
00:21:08,034 --> 00:21:09,569
and my sisters.

402
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:13,940
Creed Financial funded the lab
that created us.

403
00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:15,408
Created you?

404
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:19,412
My sisters and I...

405
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:21,080
we're clones.

406
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:25,184
They made us do
terrible things.

407
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:27,587
For years, it went on,
until we couldn't

408
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,155
take it anymore.

409
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:32,659
We stopped the guards before
they could put the collars on.

410
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:36,463
And we did what we had to do.

411
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:39,799
Fire. Fire. Fi-Fire. Fire.

412
00:21:46,706 --> 00:21:48,207
We were 13 years old.

413
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,376
Fire.

414
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:52,144
We got out.

415
00:21:52,178 --> 00:21:55,382
But we didn't escape
what they did to us,

416
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:58,751
the things they made us do.

417
00:22:00,387 --> 00:22:02,822
I know it's a risk, Lorna,

418
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:06,693
but some risks are worth taking.

419
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:17,370
I think we have a problem.

420
00:22:17,404 --> 00:22:18,371
What is it?

421
00:22:18,405 --> 00:22:20,373
I spoke to a bunch of refugees

422
00:22:20,407 --> 00:22:21,841
from the church
about what happened.

423
00:22:21,874 --> 00:22:23,510
None of them were injured.

424
00:22:23,543 --> 00:22:25,478
Isn't that a good thing?

425
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:28,180
Does seem kind of strange.

426
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:32,385
If a bunch of Purifiers bomb
a church to hurt mutants,

427
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:34,353
why were none of them hurt?

428
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:36,989
Because it's a trap.

429
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:39,091
We have to get everyone
out of here now.

430
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:40,326
I'll go get people
from the back now.

431
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,094
-Go, go.
-Too late.

432
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:51,070
They're here.

433
00:22:57,777 --> 00:22:59,646
MAN:
Come on, let's do this.

434
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:05,217
We have you surrounded.

435
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:07,754
Anyone in the Mutant Underground

436
00:23:07,787 --> 00:23:09,522
who wishes to surrender
will not be harmed.

437
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:12,224
You'll be handed over
to the proper authorities.

438
00:23:12,258 --> 00:23:14,427
They don't seem disposed
to surrender.

439
00:23:14,461 --> 00:23:16,763
They might.
Just... give it a few minutes.

440
00:23:16,796 --> 00:23:19,799
-I say we storm the castle.
-We're not... we're not

441
00:23:19,832 --> 00:23:22,401
storming anything.
We're not here for blood.

442
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:24,437
We're here for justice.
Calm down.

443
00:23:24,471 --> 00:23:26,105
What's next, Jace?
Trigger fingers

444
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:27,106
are getting awfully itchy
around here.

445
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:28,475
Does it really matter

446
00:23:28,508 --> 00:23:30,409
if we smoke 'em out
or just smoke 'em?

447
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:32,912
Yes, it matters!

448
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:35,381
Listen up and listen good.

449
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:38,250
The terrorists and the killers
are inside, not out here.

450
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,459
We're the good guys here.

451
00:23:46,493 --> 00:23:49,161
Remember that.

452
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:57,269
we can count on you?

453
00:23:57,303 --> 00:24:00,673
Still want to look over
the attack plan, but I'm in.

454
00:24:00,707 --> 00:24:03,175
You were right, you know.

455
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:05,845
If we're gonna do this,
we need to trust each other.

456
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:07,914
I'm glad we did this.

457
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:10,449
Me, too.

458
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:12,919
But don't ever make me drink
chamomile again.

459
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:39,478
Where did you hear that song?

460
00:24:39,512 --> 00:24:42,148
Uh, I don't know.

461
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:44,316
Just something
that got stuck in my head.

462
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,685
Probably from some old movie.

463
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:47,486
I don't think so.

464
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,858
That's the lullaby
I sing to my baby.

465
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:54,961
Oh, well, I, um...
I must've overheard it.

466
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:56,963
My aunt sang it to me
when I was a kid.

467
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:58,397
She learned it from my mom.

468
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,232
It's all I have from her.

469
00:25:00,266 --> 00:25:03,670
I only sing it to Dawn
when we're alone.

470
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:08,207
Were you in my baby's head?

471
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,009
Lorna,
what are you talking about?

472
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:11,811
Answer me. When Dawn stopped
crying earlier,

473
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:13,212
was that you in her head?

474
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:14,881
No, I-I would never
do something...

475
00:25:14,914 --> 00:25:17,516
-Don't lie to me!
-Uh, I didn't mean any harm.

476
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,218
She-she was upset, and I...

477
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:20,753
-Is this your idea of trust?

478
00:25:20,787 --> 00:25:22,989
Is anything you tell me
even real?

479
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:25,592
Please, y-you...
you don't understand.

480
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:27,493
No, I understand. Nothing

481
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,662
-you say is real.

482
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:30,997
Please, Lorna,

483
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,599
-I can't breathe.

484
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:37,904
If you or your sisters so much

485
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:42,809
as look at my daughter again,
I will kill you.

486
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,086
-Sorry.

487
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,088
I couldn't let you do something
you'd regret.

488
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:01,227
Just keep your monsters away
from me and my daughter.

489
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,264
Esme, are you okay?

490
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,638
Dr. Taylor's office
is just up here.

491
00:26:11,671 --> 00:26:13,239
Listen.

492
00:26:13,272 --> 00:26:14,807
I want to talk to you
about what happened

493
00:26:14,841 --> 00:26:16,075
with you and Andy
at the hospital.

494
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:17,877
I feel like

495
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,979
I pressured you to face him
when you weren't ready.

496
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:21,981
I keep telling you, Mom...

497
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:24,050
that wasn't your fault.

498
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:27,754
I just can't let go of the idea
that we can get through to him.

499
00:26:27,787 --> 00:26:30,322
We had another dream last night.

500
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:34,927
You really think
he's having these dreams, too?

501
00:26:34,961 --> 00:26:36,428
I know he is.

502
00:26:36,462 --> 00:26:39,331
You wouldn't recognize him.

503
00:26:39,365 --> 00:26:40,800
He's different.

504
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:42,601
He's gotten so much stronger.

505
00:26:42,635 --> 00:26:44,503
I've been talking to John.

506
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:47,106
Andy getting stronger
isn't unusual.

507
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:50,910
Powers develop and-and change.

508
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:54,647
-Yours might, too.
-And then what?

509
00:26:54,681 --> 00:26:56,082
Fight Andy again?

510
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:57,817
Hopefully,
it-it doesn't come to that.

511
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,451
He-he may come home when he...

512
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:01,520
-He's not coming home.
-Well, when he realizes

513
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:02,955
-what he's doing is wrong...
-You still don't get it.

514
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:06,659
Andy doesn't want to be saved.

515
00:27:06,693 --> 00:27:09,261
He believes the Inner Circle
is helping people.

516
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:10,663
Mutants are calling them heroes.

517
00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:15,567
Maybe he's right.

518
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:21,507
Maybe we're the ones
that need to be saved.

519
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,776
Thank you so much for seeing us

520
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,778
on such short notice,
Dr. Taylor.

521
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:27,780
Of course.

522
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:31,684
It's such a tragedy,
what happened at the hospital.

523
00:27:31,718 --> 00:27:33,119
Tea?

524
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:35,554
Uh, sure.

525
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:38,624
Now, which patient
were you here about?

526
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,392
I don't think you mentioned.

527
00:27:40,426 --> 00:27:43,662
Um, we were hoping
you could tell us what happened

528
00:27:43,696 --> 00:27:47,566
to our cousin, a-a young woman,
her name's Rebecca Hoover.

529
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:50,069
She's... your cousin?

530
00:27:51,103 --> 00:27:53,472
Uh, yes, um...

531
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,474
we haven't been close

532
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,376
with that side of the family
for a while.

533
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:59,078
It's just... now that we know

534
00:27:59,111 --> 00:28:00,847
that the X-Gene is
in our bloodline,

535
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,216
we thought we should get
to know more about her, maybe

536
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,818
what she can do.

537
00:28:05,852 --> 00:28:07,386
I, uh...

538
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:09,688
I'll tell you what I can.

539
00:28:09,722 --> 00:28:13,059
I haven't worked at the hospital
for a while, of course.

540
00:28:13,092 --> 00:28:16,095
Yes, and-and why did you leave,
exactly?

541
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:19,398
I had issues with the treatment
of some of the patients.

542
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:22,001
Any time people are committed
against their will,

543
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,003
it's a difficult situation.

544
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,371
Mm.

545
00:28:26,472 --> 00:28:28,875
Why don't I go get my notes?

546
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:35,281
Something's wrong.

547
00:28:35,314 --> 00:28:37,416
Lauren, I know
you don't like this...

548
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:39,618
No, it's not that.
She's scared.

549
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:42,088
-Why would she be scared?
-I don't know.

550
00:28:42,121 --> 00:28:43,389
Hey, Lauren.

551
00:28:43,422 --> 00:28:45,557
Yes, please, I need help.

552
00:28:51,263 --> 00:28:54,767
-Now let's try this again.

553
00:28:54,801 --> 00:28:57,937
Tell me... about Rebecca Hoover.

554
00:29:03,342 --> 00:29:05,912
-Please, what do you want?
-We just need information.

555
00:29:05,945 --> 00:29:07,379
I can't talk about my patients.

556
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:08,547
Patients?

557
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,383
You tortured those people.

558
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:13,619
I treated them as best
as I could.

559
00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:15,788
Locking them in cages
like animals!

560
00:29:15,822 --> 00:29:17,489
Hey, I know
you did the best you could.

561
00:29:17,523 --> 00:29:20,392
I spoke to one of your patients.

562
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:22,761
Michael. Do you remember him?

563
00:29:22,795 --> 00:29:25,497
He said you were kind to him.

564
00:29:25,531 --> 00:29:27,900
That's why we came to you.

565
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:29,969
I tried,

566
00:29:30,002 --> 00:29:32,504
but it wasn't up to me.

567
00:29:32,538 --> 00:29:35,842
-I should have done more.
-Then help us now.

568
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:39,411
Michael said you felt bad
about how they treated Rebecca,

569
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:41,814
that she was abused
and-and locked up.

570
00:29:41,848 --> 00:29:44,250
Some very dangerous people
took her,

571
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:45,985
and we need to find out why.

572
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,322
Because they also have my son.

573
00:29:50,356 --> 00:29:53,960
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

574
00:29:53,993 --> 00:29:55,227
What?

575
00:29:57,396 --> 00:30:00,066
I need to show you something.

576
00:30:03,202 --> 00:30:05,838
We recorded all of our patient
sessions at the hospital.

577
00:30:05,872 --> 00:30:07,539
We had to drug her.

578
00:30:07,573 --> 00:30:10,109
Otherwise, she could just
turn her collar inside out.

579
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:12,178
The cops found that out
the hard way.

580
00:30:12,211 --> 00:30:14,713
She has the ability
to twist things.

581
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:17,683
A sort of dimensional
manipulation.

582
00:30:17,716 --> 00:30:19,651
This was after she first came.

583
00:30:19,685 --> 00:30:21,787
We thought she was on her meds.
We were wrong.

584
00:30:27,994 --> 00:30:30,629
I quit the hospital
the same day.

585
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,831
The autopsy said

586
00:30:32,865 --> 00:30:34,700
she turned them inside out.

587
00:30:34,733 --> 00:30:36,702
Oh, God.

588
00:30:36,735 --> 00:30:39,671
That's how I knew
you weren't Rebecca's family.

589
00:30:41,607 --> 00:30:43,542
That's how she killed them, too.

590
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:54,486
Talk about amateur hour.

591
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,322
Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy.

592
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:57,990
You started having feelings
all over the place

593
00:30:58,024 --> 00:30:59,691
and let your guard down.

594
00:30:59,725 --> 00:31:01,727
-I did what I had
to do to convince her.
-Yeah.

595
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,195
-She looked really convinced.
-I believe

596
00:31:03,229 --> 00:31:05,664
the last thing I said to you was
"Don't make me regret it."

597
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,033
Don't worry.

598
00:31:07,066 --> 00:31:08,467
We broke it, we'll...

599
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,570
-Fix it.
-We can't afford

600
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:13,239
to make any more mistakes.

601
00:31:13,272 --> 00:31:15,174
We need Lorna
for this plan to work,

602
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:16,875
and we need her by tomorrow.

603
00:31:16,909 --> 00:31:20,579
Well, we'll just have to use
a more... direct approach.

604
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:23,349
We can't control Lorna
like that, not forever.

605
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:24,683
Between the three of us,

606
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,685
we can do it long enough
to fix your mistake.

607
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,087
Controlling people's minds

608
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,956
can't be the solution
to everything.

609
00:31:29,989 --> 00:31:31,857
Esme, that's what we do.

610
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,625
That's what we are.

611
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:37,063
No, that's what he wanted us
to be.

612
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,971
You said
we're building a new world.

613
00:31:45,004 --> 00:31:46,772
But if we're gonna build
something lasting,

614
00:31:46,805 --> 00:31:48,474
something real,

615
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:52,911
then people need to believe,
especially Lorna.

616
00:31:58,617 --> 00:32:00,419
I admire your passion, Esme,

617
00:32:00,452 --> 00:32:02,388
but we can't afford
to get sentimental.

618
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:04,490
We're all making
sacrifices here.

619
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:29,982
Hey, guys, grab your stuff
and let's go.

620
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,820
It's Jace Turner
again. He was at the clinic.

621
00:32:34,853 --> 00:32:36,155
He must have tracked us here
somehow.

622
00:32:36,188 --> 00:32:38,757
He's almost as good as you.

623
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,027
Look, if you can portal
everyone there,

624
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,694
we got a straight shot
to the road.

625
00:32:42,728 --> 00:32:45,131
They're gonna notice when we
pop up behind them like gophers.

626
00:32:45,164 --> 00:32:46,465
I don't know about you,

627
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:47,666
but I can't run faster
than a pickup truck.

628
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:49,801
Eclipse, Skyler,
and Naya can cover us.

629
00:32:49,835 --> 00:32:52,438
Shatter and I will run
interference.

630
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:55,841
Hey, everybody, on my signal,
get ready to run!

631
00:32:55,874 --> 00:32:59,145
I'm gonna open up a portal.
I need you guys to move through

632
00:32:59,178 --> 00:33:01,680
as quickly as possible and seek
cover as fast as you can.

633
00:33:02,748 --> 00:33:04,816
-Bomb!
-It's gas!

634
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,052
Everybody get out!

635
00:33:06,085 --> 00:33:07,719
Run!

636
00:33:07,753 --> 00:33:09,221
Get to the back of the building.

637
00:33:13,025 --> 00:33:14,693
-Clarice. Clarice.

638
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:16,562
Come here.

639
00:33:24,703 --> 00:33:26,638
Let's go, let's go.

640
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:28,774
-Move it! Drop down!

641
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:42,254
We have to go back
for the others.

642
00:33:42,288 --> 00:33:44,490
We can't.
That is Halothane-X gas.

643
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:46,825
If you go back there, you'll be
unconscious in seconds.

644
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,927
Halothane-X?
Didn't the cops stop using that

645
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,996
after all those people
got trampled?

646
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,232
We're not dealing with cops.

647
00:33:57,236 --> 00:33:58,937
We got to get out, man.

648
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,673
With those guys by the trucks,
we're sitting ducks.

649
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:03,842
-What do we do now?
-Is there another way out
of here?

650
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,444
There is,
there is a service tunnel

651
00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:06,845
on that side of the building.

652
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,780
But it's on the other side
of the wall.

653
00:34:08,814 --> 00:34:12,251
We use it to bring people in,
but we can't get to it

654
00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:13,485
without going back through
the gas.

655
00:34:16,922 --> 00:34:19,758
-I can help with the wall.
-Okay, well,

656
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:21,627
we're still gonna have to deal
with the guys outside.

657
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:25,030
Maybe I can take 'em out.

658
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,532
You can't go out there, man.

659
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:28,234
My body can handle most
small arms fire.

660
00:34:28,267 --> 00:34:29,468
You sure?

661
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:30,436
This the only chance we got.

662
00:34:32,671 --> 00:34:34,740
-All right.
-Okay.

663
00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:36,575
Three, two...

664
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:52,491
Come on, come on.

665
00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:53,759
Come on.

666
00:34:57,363 --> 00:34:58,964
Whoa, whoa!

667
00:34:58,997 --> 00:35:00,098
Get down!

668
00:35:01,133 --> 00:35:02,668
Damn it.

669
00:35:11,477 --> 00:35:12,378
Ray!

670
00:35:13,812 --> 00:35:14,946
Oh, hey, kid.

671
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,451
Come on, Reed.

672
00:35:19,485 --> 00:35:20,986
You can do this.

673
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,425
Look inside.

674
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,527
It's in you.

675
00:35:33,899 --> 00:35:35,867
Don't make me do this!
Get on the ground!

676
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:42,841
ut you and Mom
have never once talked

677
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:45,277
about what it might mean for me
to have Andy come home.

678
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:46,312
He's your son.

679
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:09,535
Follow him now, go, quick!

680
00:36:09,568 --> 00:36:10,502
Come on.

681
00:36:12,271 --> 00:36:15,741
Go! Get her, get her.

682
00:36:37,796 --> 00:36:40,999
I told you to stay the hell
away from us.

683
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,034
-Was I unclear?
-Look,

684
00:36:43,068 --> 00:36:44,870
if you want to
tear my head off, fine.

685
00:36:44,903 --> 00:36:46,638
Just please hear me out.

686
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,245
Um,

687
00:36:53,279 --> 00:36:57,115
I-I should never have been
inside your baby's head.

688
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:58,750
-Yeah.
-She was crying,

689
00:36:58,784 --> 00:37:01,953
and I needed to talk to you.

690
00:37:01,987 --> 00:37:06,224
It was wrong, and I'm sorry.

691
00:37:06,258 --> 00:37:08,193
But I felt something in her.

692
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,928
Something I've never
felt before.

693
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:13,031
The love of a mother.

694
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,766
I didn't have a mommy either.

695
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,135
That doesn't give you the right
to invade my child's mind.

696
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:20,872
No, it doesn't. I...

697
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:23,575
manipulated you
because we need you.

698
00:37:23,609 --> 00:37:25,944
-Because that's what we do.

699
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:30,248
We... we make people do
what we need them to do.

700
00:37:30,282 --> 00:37:33,251
That's--
that's why we were made.

701
00:37:33,285 --> 00:37:34,553
That's no excuse.

702
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:35,921
You don't just have
to accept that.

703
00:37:35,954 --> 00:37:36,855
We didn't.

704
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:41,727
You deserve to know
the whole story.

705
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,228
What are you talking about?

706
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:47,899
We didn't start off as triplets.

707
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:50,302
Esme, Phoebe, Sophie,

708
00:37:50,336 --> 00:37:51,670
report for duty.

709
00:37:51,703 --> 00:37:54,606
During our exercises,

710
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,108
they kept two of us locked up
as leverage.

711
00:37:57,142 --> 00:38:01,347
Celeste and Mindee had
to stay back that day.

712
00:38:06,852 --> 00:38:07,653
Grab your guns.

713
00:38:07,686 --> 00:38:08,820
Fire.

714
00:38:08,854 --> 00:38:09,988
When we decided to escape,

715
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:11,623
we thought we could
save everyone.

716
00:38:11,657 --> 00:38:12,958
We were wrong.

717
00:38:18,464 --> 00:38:20,732
Mindee and Celeste,
we couldn't get them out.

718
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:27,506
We never told anyone
that story before.

719
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:31,209
Not even Reeva.

720
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:34,312
I've felt death.

721
00:38:34,346 --> 00:38:37,483
I was a part of my sisters
when they died.

722
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:43,154
I felt the pain

723
00:38:43,188 --> 00:38:45,290
and the terror

724
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,958
like it was happening to me.

725
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:53,399
And I would do anything...

726
00:38:53,432 --> 00:38:56,668
anything to protect
your daughter from that.

727
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:02,307
I'm sorry, I just...

728
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:06,912
I want you to know that, whether
or not you join this fight,

729
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:11,049
I'm on your side...

730
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:12,918
and hers.

731
00:39:32,604 --> 00:39:35,407
You did it, bud.

732
00:39:35,441 --> 00:39:38,176
Authorities rolled up
the whole station.

733
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,311
Biggest mutant bust in years.

734
00:39:43,281 --> 00:39:45,451
Not how I wanted that
to go down.

735
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:52,924
Look, those were
some pretty words

736
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:54,560
about nobody getting hurt.

737
00:39:54,593 --> 00:39:57,729
But that man who died knew
what he signed up for.

738
00:39:57,763 --> 00:40:00,932
He died a hero,
and he'll inspire dozens more.

739
00:40:00,966 --> 00:40:04,002
Want to make an omelet,
you got to some break eggs.

740
00:40:06,171 --> 00:40:07,639
And that guy you cracked open?

741
00:40:07,673 --> 00:40:10,576
Turns out, Humpty Dumpty
supposedly died in Atlanta.

742
00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:13,278
You said your wife thought
you were chasing

743
00:40:13,311 --> 00:40:15,313
some loony conspiracy theory?

744
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:18,617
Well, look at you now.

745
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:22,821
Come on.

746
00:40:22,854 --> 00:40:24,122
The guys are buying rounds
of Patrón.

747
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,958
You're one of us now, brother.

748
00:40:31,296 --> 00:40:32,998
Lauren, wait.

749
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:35,400
There's something
I need to tell you.

750
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,002
What, what is it?

751
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:40,138
I've been thinking, and I
realized, with this whole trip,

752
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:42,774
I am making the same mistake
as before,

753
00:40:42,808 --> 00:40:44,743
dragging you into a fight
that is not yours.

754
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:45,977
Mom...

755
00:40:46,011 --> 00:40:48,146
It is not on you
to bring Andy back.

756
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:50,048
It's on me.

757
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,085
Oh, God.

758
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:55,521
Honey, you know I love you

759
00:40:55,554 --> 00:40:57,122
every bit as much
as your brother, right?

760
00:40:57,155 --> 00:41:02,160
I-I would never put you at risk
to save him.

761
00:41:03,228 --> 00:41:04,963
I know that.

762
00:41:06,632 --> 00:41:08,634
But you saw the same thing
I did.

763
00:41:08,667 --> 00:41:11,336
Andy thinks he's doing
the right thing.

764
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:14,305
But the Inner Circle recruited
that psychopath.

765
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:16,508
If he won't come back
on his own,

766
00:41:16,542 --> 00:41:19,745
I have to fight him
and bring him back myself.

767
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:26,484
<i> Out of my, out of my</i>

768
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:33,091
<i> Out of my, out of my</i>

769
00:41:35,561 --> 00:41:38,163
<i> Get out of my head,
out of my head </i>

770
00:41:38,196 --> 00:41:40,666
<i> Yeah, we're high and low</i>

771
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:43,068
<i> You're dark at your worst</i>

772
00:41:43,101 --> 00:41:44,536
<i> You're loved
and you're cursed </i>

773
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:47,539
<i> You're high and low,
you're high and low </i>

774
00:41:47,573 --> 00:41:50,642
<i> Get out of my head,
out of my head </i>

775
00:41:50,676 --> 00:41:52,778
<i> Yeah, we're high and low</i>

776
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,883
<i> 'Cause you wanted love,
'cause you wanted </i>

777
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:02,721
<i> 'Cause you wanted,
'cause you wanted love </i>

778
00:42:02,754 --> 00:42:04,422
<i> 'Cause you wanted</i>

779
00:42:07,092 --> 00:42:11,396
<i> 'Cause you wanted love,
'cause you wanted... </i>

780
00:42:11,429 --> 00:42:14,566
What's wrong?
Where's Reed?

781
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,767
Maybe it's best if you don't.

782
00:42:15,801 --> 00:42:17,068
What?

783
00:42:29,915 --> 00:42:30,949
Oh, God...

784
00:42:30,982 --> 00:42:32,884
-Don't come any closer!

785
00:42:32,918 --> 00:42:37,122
<i> 'Cause you wanted love.</i>

786
00:42:37,155 --> 00:42:38,590
It won't stop.

787
00:42:39,725 --> 00:42:42,728
I can't make it stop.
